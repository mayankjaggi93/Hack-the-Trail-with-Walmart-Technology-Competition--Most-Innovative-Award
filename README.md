## Hack the Trail with Walmart Technology Competition

**Problem Statement:**
The Austin Parks department has time series data on foot and bike traffic on a trail near downtown Austin. This data is influenced 
by a number of conditions, including weather, time of year, day of week, major and minor events, openings of new business and event 
spaces, and other more difficult-to-predict events and trends. Using historical data, participants will attempt to develop models 
that capture these sources of variability in the data and forecast future expected traffic on various locations within the trails. 
This should include models, statistics, visualizations, and, potentially, interfacing components to allow models to be retrained 
and/or queried.


Worked on a data science project to derive insights for better resource allocation as a part of the Hack the Trail Hackathon organized by Walmart Technology. **Secured Most Innovative Award.**

Developed a multivariate time series model to forecast the hike trail traffic in Austin, TX. The forecast period included long term (Quarterly) and short term (Daily/Weekly) period. Developed a heuristic based model to plan and select the most cost-effective 
workforce allocation strategy based on the forecasts.

The Details of the project can be seen in the attached presentation.

**Repository include Data, Python, Tableau, Workforce planning tool files.**
